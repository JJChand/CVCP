NOTES FROM CHANDLER
**NO NEED TO CARE ABOUT THE IMAGES FILE AND MODLE FILES, ONLY NEED TO CARE ABOUT THE CODE FILES, since ARE FOR COPY AND PASTE CONVINENCE**
**THE ORIGINAL FILE IS DIRECTLY DOWNLOAD FROM GOOGLE DRIVE IN RASPBERRY PI**

FILE PATH: /home/raspberry/Downloads/CVCP
1, cd to this file path:
[cd /home/raspberry/Downloads/CVCP]
or
2, click the file icon on upper left corner(which should be next to the terminal)-----> find the "home" file----->"Downloads"----->CVCP, then copy the path if Chandler i make a typo mistake

***In CVCP, i construct a virtual environment called 'cp', which inlcudes all required packages already
Run the linux command to activate the virtual environment:
[source cp/bin/activate]

If the vr is successfully activated, you can see (cp)raspberry@.....(i forget but not important), what important is that (cp), it means the vr is successfully activated

Then, run the code detect.py
